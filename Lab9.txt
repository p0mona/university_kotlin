Please model the following employment structure in a company using a class hierarchy:
- An employee has a first name, last name, and salary, and a toString() method that
prints information about the class name and attribute values
- A full-time employee is an employee who has an employment contract for a
fixed or indefinite period of time
- A manager is a full-time employee who manages a specific department and
receives an additional bonus
- A director is a manager
- An associate is an employee who has a contract for services or a contract for

specific work
- A permanent associate is an associate
- A periodic associate is an associate who is employed for a certain

period.
Attributes should be private or access control should be applied using get/set.

Each class has a toString() method that uses a method from the base class.

Each class has at least two constructors.
