Please create a Fraction class representing a rational fraction. The class
should have a constructor that allows you to specify the numerator and denominator, private fields
representing the numerator and denominator, and public methods:
● add - adding fractions
● sub - subtracting fractions
● mul - multiplying fractions
● div - dividing fractions
● inv - reversing a fraction
● toString - provides a text representation of the object in the proper form “(a b/c)”
,
where a is an integer, b and c are the numerator and denominator of the fraction,
and private method(s) that implement the algorithm(s) needed to reduce
fractions.
