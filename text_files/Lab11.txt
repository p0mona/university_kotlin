Please implement a simple application that creates a “Database” that stores objects in a
collection. Please implement basic CRUD operations (saving an object to the
database, reading an object (with search), updating an object, and deleting an object).

The application should have a text menu that allows you to use it.

I leave the decision of what data will be stored in the application to you.

The application should contain the following elements of object-oriented programming:
- at least 3 classes
- interface and/or abstract class
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- composition
The application should have a user interface that allows you to perform CRUD operations (e.g. entering and displaying data from the database).
