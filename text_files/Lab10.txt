1. Let's imagine that we are implementing a graphics program that allows us to create simple
drawings composed of basic geometric shapes. The user can drag
available shapes from the menu onto the workspace, where they can adjust their size and
position. Please create a hierarchy consisting of the following elements:
- Shape interface, which declares the draw(), erase() and
transform() methods
- classes implementing this interface: Point, Line, Circle, Rectangle, Triangle â€¦
- Canvas class, which manages a collection of Shape class objects and
draws these objects in the Paint() method

Of course, we will not implement the above operations using the GUI, but
we will signal their operation by printing appropriate text messages.

2. Please modify the class structure from the previous example so that its
root is now not the interface, but an abstract class that stores information about the color
of the object being drawn and its fill (yes/no). These properties can be modified using getters and setters. You also need to modify the draw() functions to display additional information.
