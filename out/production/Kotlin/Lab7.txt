1. Please create a Group class that stores a list of students in a Map collection,
where the keys are the student index numbers. The class should have two functions
that return a student based on the index number:
a. getStudentByIDorNull, which returns null if there is no student
with the given index
b. getStudentByID, which does not return null but throws an exception
NoSuchElementException
Please test the operation of both functions, handling both nullable types (using
the if, ?., ?: and !! statements), as well as exceptions
2. Please create a generic display function that will display a numbered
list of elements of any type T .
3. Please modify the Group class so that it can store a group
of objects of any type. Please place the display function written in the previous point
in it so that it displays a list of objects stored in the Group class.
