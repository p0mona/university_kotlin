1. Please write a program that prints prime numbers in lines. The first
line should print prime numbers <= 2, and each subsequent line should print numbers smaller
than or equal to the next power of 2 (4, 8, 16, 32…). If the number 13 appears
among the numbers found, it should not be printed (continue should be used). If the number 11057 appears
among the numbers found, the loop execution should be interrupted (break with a label should be
used). 
2. Please create an Animal interface that has the speak() and eat() methods
returning values ​​of type String. Then, please create three classes of any animals
that implement this interface and both methods. 
3. Please modify the Student class so that it has three constructors:
a. the main constructor, which accepts only the student's name as a parameter. The student should receive the next generated index number and
a grade of 3.0
b. an additional constructor that takes the student's name and
the index number as a parameter, and the student receives a grade of 3.0
c. an additional constructor that takes the student's name, index number
and grade as a parameter.
Please use the init block and the chain of constructors called using
this.
