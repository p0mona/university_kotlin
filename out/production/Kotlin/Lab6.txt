1. Using the Student class from the previous exercises, please implement the student's grade as an enumerated type Grade.

2. Please create a function that calculates the following grade statistics for students in
a group:
a. minimum
b. maximum
c. average
d. standard deviation
The function should return an appropriately defined data class object that
will be subject to destructuring, e.g.
val (min, max, sr, d) = stat(students)
